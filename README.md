# Possible Article about `Uncovering Latent Structure in Gliomas Using Multi-Omics Factor Analysis`

This repository contains code for analyzing glioma heterogeneity using a sparse dimensionality reduction methods: **MOFA** (Multi-Omics Factor Analysis).

## Structure.
- All preprocessing and analysis steps are provided in `.Rmd` files.

- The factors/loadings used are saved in folder `mofa-output`.
- The results regarding MOFA presented can be obtained by running `mofa-results.R` file.
- The results regarding the "new classificaiton" are in `mofa-more` and can be generated by running `mofa-more.R`. 

## Datasets
- Only the mutations dataset and the corresponding ground-truth labels for each patient are included directly in this repository. The ground-truth labels are based on the classification described in [this study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.19.529134v3.full.pdf).
- Other omics datasets (e.g., mRNA, miRNA, methylation) can be downloaded using the code in the provided `.Rmd` notebooks.
- **Note:** The **DNA methylation** dataset is ~8 GB. Due to its size, we recommend using the GDC Data Transfer Tool:
  1. Obtain the manifest file using the code in the script.
  2. Download the data via terminal using the [GDC client](https://gdc.cancer.gov/access-data/gdc-data-transfer-tool).


## Notes
- This project comes from a Masterâ€™s thesis, supervised by Prof./Dr. Alexandra Sofia Martins de Carvalho and Prof./Dr. Susana de Almeida Mendes Vinga Martins.
